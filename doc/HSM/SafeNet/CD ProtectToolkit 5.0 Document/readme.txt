Documentation DVD Contents
=================================================================
This DVD contains all of the end-user documentation for PTK 5.0 
and the new ProtectServer 2 HSMs (PSE2 and PSI-E2). 

PTK FM SDK
----------
In previous releases, the PTK FM SDK (formerly PPO) documentation
was bundled with the PPO software on a separate DVD. This release
consolidates all of the PTK documentation, including the PTK FM
SDK documentation onto the documentation DVD, and all of the 
software, including the PTK FM SDK software, onto the PTK
software DVD.

Migration Guide
---------------
The new ProtectServer 2 HSMs (PSE2 and PSI-E2) use a different 
cyrptographic engine (K6) than was used in the legacy
ProtectServer HSMs (K5). As a result, you must recompile your FMs
to run on the new hardware. This may require changes to your code.
This and other changes introduced in ProtectServer 2 are detailed
in the ProtectServer 2 Migration Guide. It is strongly 
recommended that you read this document before you deploy PTK 5.0.
